This tutorial

This tutorial will guide you to create a fully featured page including custom data model, permission, template and localization components. This is the most complete guide (yet) to creating a custom page for UserFrosting and summarizes everything covered by this documentation so far. This guide is intended for advanced users. If you come across any terminology that you do not fully understand, please use the search bar to search the documentation for an explanation.

>>> This tutorial assumes that the reader has already [set up their own sprinkle](/sprinkles/first-site) and is familiar with the base components, including [Twig](/templating-with-twig), [routing](/routes-and-controllers/front-controller), [Controller classes](/routes-and-controllers/controller-classes), and [Eloquent data models](/database/overview).
