We now have a complete, though very basic page to display a table of data dynamically powered by the database. But, there is a lot more we can still do to improve this page! Continue on with Part 2 of the Advanced Tutorial or explore the documentation to learn how to add more features to your pastry page:

- [Create automated tests for your code](/advanced/automated-tests)
- [Create a custom Bakery command](/cli/custom-commands)

## Source code

You can find the complete source code from this part of the tutorial on the `the-basics` branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/userfrosting/pastries).
