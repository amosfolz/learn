# Advanced Tutorial Extended

This tutorial will build upon [Part 1 (The basics)](/recipes/advanced-tutorial/basics) by integrating additional components and functionality. We will add data pagination, sorting, and filtering using a custom Sprunje and then dynamically fetch and display data in ufTable. In addition, we will look at how to use ufForm and ufModal to add create, edit, and delete modal forms.
