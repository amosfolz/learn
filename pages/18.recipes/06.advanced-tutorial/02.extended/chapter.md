# Extended

This tutorial will build upon [Part 1 (The basics)](/recipes/advanced-tutorial/basics) by adding additional components and functionality, including data pagination, sorting, and filtering using a custom Sprunje and then dynamically fetch and display data in ufTable. In addition, we will look at how to use ufForm and ufModal to add create, edit, and delete modal forms.
